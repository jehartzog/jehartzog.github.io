<h2>Under the Ocean</h2>

<p>After graduating from Duke University with a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Mandarin Chinese and Economics, I went on to release my blockbuster <a href="/projects/stickwars">StickWars</a> iOS game and to learn how to <a href="/blog/submarine-officer">drive a submarine</a>. After completing my training and being assigned to a submarine, my development career was put on hold as I drove around underneath the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<h2>Back on Dry Land</h2>

<p>I finished my tour at sea and came back to a development environment that had changed significantly over the years. I needed to catch up with the times, but I was still employed full time in a job so I used my after-hours time to gain experience with the modern toolsets. I started with supporting small PHP site running Moodle and other small projects on evenings/weekends.</p>

<p>After I separating from the Navy, I migrated immediately to full time development and built my first major web app, creating the <a href="/projects/skoolers">Skoolers Tutoring</a> online platform which currently supports thousands of students at multiple universities.</p>
