# About Skoolers

With thousands of enrollees, [Skoolers](https://www.skoolerstutoring.com) is one of the largest independent tutoring companies serving University of Florida and Florida State University students. Not affiliated with either universities, they are a small group of tutors with over 10+ years of experience helping students master some of the must brutal courses students struggle through, including business finance, physics, math, and chemistry. They've made such a reputation for themselves that students seek out their review sessions, asking for them by name.

# The task

With a library of over 10,000 videos and students hungry to devour over 10 TB worth of video bandwidth a month, Skoolers needs a solution to deliver those videos in a streamlined, cost-efficient way. The tutors also need a online discussion forum for the students, along with sharing files and review schedules.

# The solution

After putting together the plan, I was able to produce a replacement solution based on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), running on [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) servers with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) powering the front-end. [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) hosts all of the videos, and files are hosted by [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

# Development experience

I've assembled some dev [details](/blog/skoolers-app-details) about the app along with my experiences in observing the app [scale from 0 to 1000+ users](/blog/scaling-with-meteor) and making [heavy use of the Vimeo API](/blog/writing-the-book-on-vimeo-api-rate-limiting).

In the process I've also released an open source [package](/blog/meteor-galaxy-autoscale) to help efficiently auto-scale Meteor Galaxy hosted apps, and made a number of [posts](/tags#skoolers) about various pitfalls and lessons learned while building the app.
