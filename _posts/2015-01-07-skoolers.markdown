## About Skoolers

With thousands of enrollees, [Skoolers](http://www.skoolerstutoring.com) is one of the largest online teaching organization serving University of Florida and Florida State University students.

## The Task

With a library of over 10,000 videos and students hungry to devour over 10 TB worth of video bandwidth a month, Skoolers needed a solution to deliver those videos in a streamlined, cost-efficient way.

## The Quick Solution

Skoolers was limping along with an open-source [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) (PHP) based website that was pieced together just enough to function.

## The Good Solution

After putting together the plan, I was able to produce a replacement solution based on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), running on Node.JS servers with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) powering the front-end.

More fun tech stuff will come about how this was solved, but first, must finish tweaking the site for the client...
